This is an OOP ReactJS project, in which you can:
1. Choose your favorite user.
2. Search for a movie of your choice from an updated movie database (an external Api).
3. Read the movie's synopsis. 
4. Rent it accordingly to your budget limits.  

The source of data for the users is a data.json, but a preperation for connection to a MongoDB was made on the server-side.
