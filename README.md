This is an OOP ReactJS project, in which you can:
1. Choose your favorite user.
2. Search for a movie of your choice from an updated movie database (an external Api).
3. Read the movie's synopsis. 
4. Rent it accordingly to your budget limits.  


The source of data for the users is a data.json, but a preparation for connection to MongoDB was made on the server-side.

Later version of this project will make it full stack using Node.js and Express.
